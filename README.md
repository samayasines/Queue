This project implements a Queue data structure using a singly linked list in C#.
It includes basic queue operations such as:

Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.

Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.

Peek: View the front element without removing it.

Display: Show all elements in the queue.

IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.

Useful for understanding how queues work internally using linked lists.
